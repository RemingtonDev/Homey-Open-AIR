The Open AIR Mini is an open-source, ESP32-based controller that brings smart ventilation to DucoBox Silent and Orcon MVS-15xx systems. This app connects directly to your Open AIR Mini over the ESPHome native API, with automatic device discovery and sensor detection.

Supported sensors are detected automatically, including temperature, humidity, CO2 (SCD-40, Senseair S8), VOC and NOx (SGP-41). Dual sensor slots are supported. The app works with both modern encryption keys and legacy password authentication.
